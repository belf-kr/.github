`A todo service to share user's course`

</div>

[`í•œêµ­ì–´(KR)`](./README.md) | [English](./README.en-US.md)

> Have you ever use Todo application not to forget what todo in your life? Haven't you ever wanted to share well-organized todo?
> Our service solve your needs!

Belf is project for graduation homework. We decided to develop a web service product line with my team member, and while thinking about what service to develop, ðŸ¤” Since we work and learn at the same time, it would be difficult to set the project level high from the beginning, so why don't we create a service while expanding the function to `continue` in a simple Todo app? That's the conclusion and the project was carried out accordingly.

In addition to the basic function of Todo, the to-do list was named `course`, and the ability to derive new insights by directly copying other people's to-do through sharing the `course` conducted by others was created.

It is not a huge project to be developed by `MSA`, but we judged it would be more productive to be developed by `MSA` to expend our experiences and defferences among team members' stack.
You can check out type of service or used stack in [repo of org](https://github.com/orgs/belf-kr/repositories), we distribute and manage using `k8s`

</p>

### What is the address of the service and how to use it? ðŸ“±

It is [https://belf.xyz](https://belf.xyz). We also write down the URL in the Organization profile marked as ðŸ”—at the top.

You can read the instruction for how to use the service in [Menual of service](https://parkgang.notion.site/36f01d56dff643dfa1db264e33f18d7d).

### MSA is architected like below ðŸ”¥

We attached a `k8s` related diagram because several services are managed by the `service` level in `k8s`.

> You can check out the k8s cluster has 3 nodes and 6 services are run.
